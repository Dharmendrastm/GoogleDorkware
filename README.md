üîç Google Dorkware ‚Äì Project Summary

Project Title: Google Dorkware ‚Äì A Google Dork Search Engine

Overview:
Google Dorkware is a web-based tool designed to simplify the use of advanced Google search operators (commonly known as Google Dorks) to identify sensitive information, misconfigurations, and potential vulnerabilities indexed by search engines. The tool provides a user-friendly interface that helps cybersecurity enthusiasts, bug bounty hunters, and penetration testers quickly generate and execute dork queries.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: (Optional/Future scope ‚Äì can be integrated with PHP/Python)

APIs: Opens Google search in a new tab with the crafted dork query

Key Features:

Predefined Google Dorks categorized by vulnerability type (e.g., SQL errors, login pages, exposed documents, sensitive directories)

Real-time query builder with custom input fields (e.g., target domain, filetype)

One-click search execution using Google

Clean, responsive user interface for better usability

Use Case:
This tool aids in ethical hacking and reconnaissance by automating the generation of search queries that would otherwise be manually crafted. It educates users on how Google Dorking works and speeds up the information-gathering phase of penetration testing.

Target Users:

Cybersecurity researchers

Bug bounty hunters

Ethical hackers

Students learning about OSINT and reconnaissance

Learning Outcomes:

Gained hands-on experience in building a web application using HTML/CSS/JS

Understood how search engines index data and how that can be leveraged for security analysis

Explored ethical and responsible usage of Google Dorks in penetration testing
